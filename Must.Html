It is indeed a great moment for me to lead one of the prestigious engineering universities of the country. It is really an honor for me that I have been appointed as Vice Chancellor, where I started my career as a lecturer, way back in 1987. In 1996, after doing PhD from UK, I dreamed for Mehran UET to be amongst the top universities of the country as well in the world. 

Envisaging my dream for Mehran UET, I worked in different capacities, as Registrar and Pro Vice Chancellor and my focus was embedded in raising the educational & research standards at par with the best universities of the world. By the grace of Almighty Allah, Mehran UET is now considered as, distinguished public sector engineering university at national & international level, ranked as 1st in province Sindh and 2nd in Pakistan. I had a dream to see Mehran University amongst the top universities of the world. This dream of mine and my team has come true. Mehran University has been ranked 351st amongst the top 400 universities of the world, as ranked by “QS Top World University Ranking 2010”. Having achieved this laurel of success the next milestone is to see Mehran University in top 100 universities of the world.

Mehran UET in 1963 was established as a constituent college of Sindh University. In 1977, it was chartered as Mehran University of Engineering & Technology. The Mehran UET as a constituent college of Sindh university started its journey from 02 departments and now Alhamdullilah Mehran UET has 31 departments, institutes, directorates, centers and one campus at Khairpur Mir’s, offering courses at undergraduate and postgraduate level in the emerging areas in engineering, science & technology.  Mehran university constituent college at Nawabsahah is now Quid e Awam University of Engineering, Science & Technology, having a campus at Larkana. Mehran UET enjoys enviable standing now and it has become pioneer institute for the aspiring young talent of the province of Sindh, especially the remote rural areas, where Engineering & Technical education is a dream for them. In 2013, Mehran UET celebrated its 50 year Golden Jubilee Celebrations.

I am very delighted to report that the quality of our graduates is recognized by the employers in public and private sector, who offer jobs to our students even before the announcement of the results. Our alumni are contributing in their professions and have earned senior positions in public & private sector nationally and internationally.

Mehran UET has transformed and evolved from undergraduate degree awarding institute to Research University in last 10 years. Mehran UET is committed to raise the research quality by employing PhD’s in conventional fields as well as in emerging areas of engineering & Technology. In this context, Mehran UET is fortunate to have wealth of resources of high quality faculty members, who produce research papers in impact factor journals, in addition to production of quality PhDs every year in Engineering & Technology. As a research oriented university, we now have substantial population of postgraduate and undergraduate in the tune of 2,000 students.

With the help and support of the dedicated & high caliber faculty, talented students & competent staff, Mehran UET is striving hard for achieving many milestones in near future. I am confident that with the commitment of my colleagues and prayers of our well-wishers, Mehran UET will become paragon of excellence by becoming top 100 universities of the world and the top model university in Pakistan. We at Mehran UET are trend setters and leaders, not blind followers.

<h3 style="color:steelblue"> Brief History</h3>
<h3 style="color:skyblue">A Brief History of Mehran University</h3>
A Brief History
Industrial and technological development in Pakistan has been quite rapid since its independence and particularly during the sixties and seventies. The main fields of development have been related to the enhancement of agriculture, establishment and up-gradation of industries and exploration of its indigenous resources. This development has resulted in increased demand for qualified engineers in different fields in addition to other professionals. In order to meet this demand and to provide an opportunity of engineering education to the people hailing from the interior of Sindh Province, Sindh University Engineering College was established in 1963 as a constituent college of University of Sindh (then spelt 'Sind') in Jamshoro about 15 km. from Hyderabad on the right bank of river Indus. 

The Education Policy of 1972 provided for upgradation of the Sindh University Engineering College to the level of a University of Engineering and Technology. Accordingly, the college was first declared as an additional campus of the University of Sindh headed by a Pro-Vice-Chancellor in July 1976 and later upgraded to the level of a fully fledged independent University on 1st March, 1977 through an ordinance issued by the Government of Sindh. The ordinance was later converted into an Act of the Provincial Assembly of Sindh Province. Initially, the Additional Campus as well the Mehran University was established in the City of Nawabshah. However, in 1979, the Act of the University was amended and the seat of the University was retained at Jamshoro, while a constituent college was maintained at Nawabshah which has also become an independent university in 1996.

In order to promote Engineering education to the people of interior Sindh at their door step, the Government of Sindh established a constituent college of Mehran University of Engineering & Technology named as “Mehran University College of Engineering & Technology, Khairpur Mir’s”. The college has been upgraded as a Campus of Mehran University of Engineering & Technology, Jamshoro, and renamed as “Mehran University of Engineering & Technology, Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Khairpur Mir’s Campus”

The number of students admitted to the First Year classes of all the disciplines under regular scheme at Jamshoro is 1053 out of which 1000 candidates are admitted from Sindh Province, including Karachi Division, according to a precisely calculated ratio of population and other considerations. 34 applicants are admitted from other parts of Pakistan while 19 seats are reserved for the foreigners. Whereas under Self Finance Scheme and Special Scheme 548 and 86 candidates are admitted from Sindh province respectively.

The number of students admitted to the First Year classes of all four disciplines at Khairpur Mir’s Campus is 244 out of which 60 candidates are admitted under Self Finance Scheme. The detailed distribution of the seats is given in Prospectus. 

Most of the laboratories and workshops of the teaching departments are properly equipped and practical as well as demonstrational training is imparted to the students wherever applicable. Continuous efforts are ongoing to upgrade these facilities for the practical training and new equipment is acquired for this purpose. Additionally, training to the concerned staff is also organized within the University as well as outside. In some cases, where the training facilities are not available within the University, the students are sent to suitable institutes in Karachi or elsewhere to undergo adequate training. Every department has been provided adequate number of personal computers and e-mail and Internet facilities for the training and use of the students as well teaching staff.

The postgraduate courses were started in the University in 1978 leading to Master’s Degree, initially, in three branches. At present, courses are offered in the specialized fields of ‘Structural Engineering, Civil Engineering, Geo-technical and Highway Engineering, Construction Management, City and Regional Planning, Irrigation and Drainage Engineering, Environmental Engineering & Management, Manufacturing Engineering, Energy Systems Engineering , Chemical Engineering, Industrial Engineering & Management, Mining Engineering, Metallurgy and Materials Engineering, Telecommunication and Control Engineering, Telecommunication Engineering & Management, Communication Systems Network, Information Technology, Telemedicine & e-Health Systems, Software Engineering, Computer & Information Technology, Electrical Power Engineering and Electronic System Engineering. Some courses are offered full time during the day while others are conducted during the evenings. The degrees to be awarded may be Post-graduate Diploma (P.G.D.), Master of Engineering (M.E.), Master of Science (M.S), Master of Philosophy (M. Phil.) or Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.); depending upon the quality and quantity of the research/work completed.

Post-graduate studies and research are organized by various departments as well as the following specialized institutes.

Institute of Water  Resource Engineering & Management
Institute of Environmental Engineering and Management
Institute of Petroleum & Natural Gas Engineering
Institute of Information & Communication Technologies
Mehran University Institute of  Science & Technology Development
Directorate of Post-graduate Studies
More details about the Post-graduate courses, curricula, duration, fees, etc., are provided separately in the Prospectus of Post-graduate studies; which may be obtained from the office of the Director, of the Institute concerned.

Hostel facilities are also available for about 1000 students on the campus both male and female; which are located at walking distance from the teaching departments. These hostels are equipped with necessary facilities including bathrooms, reading rooms, game rooms, dining halls, etc. Other facilities available for the students include medical care, transport, games and recreation, Library and so on.

It is a matter of pleasure for me to introduce the Office of Research, Innovation & Commercialization (ORIC). As all of us know that we used to have three directorates viz. Directorate of Research, Continuing Education and Industrial Liaison which were offering various services to the engineering community, industry and society for example – continuous engineering and technical awareness, communication skills, confidence build measures, strategic and time management skills through organization of various workshops and seminars, arrangement of internships, keeping records of research and tracking citation record of faculty members.

Despite of all this, there were various bottlenecks and improvement was required to achieve the best possible results out of the vested resources of the university. This was only possible through continuous reform and improvements in our research policies, objective oriented relationship with industry and demand bases continuing education courses. One of the most important aspect was the integration of all these services and their commercialization to make a way forward for university’s self-dependence. To achieve all these objectives, we need a strong commitment, monitoring and feedback from various stakeholders including the faculty, students and university management.

Owing to the importance of the aims and objectives of the aforementioned directorates in the improvement of the ranking of this university, recently a new directorate has been established namely Office of Research, Innovation and Commercialization (ORIC). I would like to take this opportunity to share the aims and objectives of the newly established directorate of ORIC as under:

Supporting the university’s strategic research directions and policies
Increasing and diversifying external research funding
Providing the guide-lines to faculty, officials and students of the university for acquiring the various grants
Improving recruitment and retention of top faculty
Improving transformation of research into the public benefit (patent development)
Strengthening university-industry relationships
Promoting entrepreneurship, technology-transfer and commercialization activities that energize and support the local and national economy
Organization of continual professional development (CPD) courses
Effective use of infrastructure, equipment and human resources
Enhancement in the university’s endowment fund
In pursuance of above objectives, allow me to inform you that in this short time of its emergence, the directorate has developed the data-base of Ph.D. faculty including their impact factor, citation factor, projects funding and other achievements/contributions, has organized various events on campus and plan to launch two series of Certificate/CPD Courses which will start from 22nd October, 2013 and onwards.

At the end, I request to all the stakeholders of the university and engineering community to please come forward in sharing your ideas, observations and feedback for the betterment of this directorate and ultimately for the future prospectus of MUET, Jamshoro.

God bless us.

<h3 style="color:green">4.English Language development Center</h3>
Introduction
In the year 1988, the English Language Development Centre was established in collaboration with the British Council and the University Grant's Commission (Presently the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan) at Mehran University Jamshoro. This Centre was initially run by a British Director Prof Brian Bamber. The major aim of this centre was to help students and faculty to improve their English in order to fully understand engineering courses taught in English. Later under expansion phase, ELDC was relocated to its new state of the art building at MUET Jamshoro. Acknowledging performance of the Centre, ELDC was included amongst 5 shortlisted institutions in public universities of Pakistan considered by English Language Teaching Reforms Project (ELTR) of HEC Pakistan for establishment of National Centre for English Language Teaching and Research. Later, the ELTR Project of the HEC of Pakistan established the state of the art self-access center at the ELDC MUET Jamshoro which is considered as the first in province Sindh and hub of teachers' training in the province. The SAC offers training on Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) and Internet based learning (IML). In 2014, catering to the needs of the teacher community, ELDC started MS program in field of Linguistics which is recognized by HEC of Pakistan. In 2020, ELDC launched its first-ever undergraduate program BS English as part of its expansion phase.

In March 2019, ELDC in collobration with Higher Education Commission of Pakistan organized its first international conference on Challenges & Innovations in 21st century (ICELL’19) at Mehran University of Engineering & Technology, Jamshoro. This conference was attended by international and national scholars of eminence such as David Crystal.
